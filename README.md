# Password_Generator

The password generator activity was to create a password generator that would prompt the users for the following selections. 

1.) Prompt how long the user wanted their new password to be. (8-128 characters)
2.) Prompt if the user wanted numbers in their password. 
3.) Prompt if the user wanted special characters in their password. 
4.) Prompt if the user wanted lower case letters in their password. 
5.) Prompt if the user wanted upper case letters in their password. 

After all of these the user must recieive an indication if they typed something incorrectly. 

Finally, if the user selected no for numbers/special characters/lower case/upper case then an alert should be shown and a default password should be applied.
